                  </h2>
                  Paul Graham of Y Combinator echoes this sentiment through a strategy adopted by Stripe, which he
                  dubbed “Collision Installation” - Stripe would physically install the app on customers’ laptops.

            <h2>Learning Curve <strong>Reduced</strong>
            </h2>
            <p>One of the barriers to adoption in this space is the learning curve associated with different points of
              sale.</p>
            <p class="text-intro">Restaurateurs don’t have a lot of love for the solutions they currently use, but the
              thought of implementing a similar point of sale, and having to go through the process of familiarising
              themselves with something new is a daunting and expensive task.<br /><br />The training associated with
              this switch-over can take anywhere from 5-7 days, sometimes even longer, and it costs in the realm of
              R7500 - R10 000 - reserves a restaurant doesn’t have after an excessively high capital outlay for
              hardware. We’ve innovated, by an order of magnitude, at every step of the process - providing a shop more
              than enough reason to make that switch. We would like the process of training and on-boarding to be just
              as innovative, and another compelling differentiator.</p>

          <h2>Phase 2...</h2>
          <p>Modifications and updates made to Smooth, as a result of our close interaction with the stores from the
            early roll-out, will set us up for expansive marketing efforts in this phase. At this point, we’ve
            re-defined the restaurant hardware and software landscape, by driving up the value of the software offering,
            while simultaneously driving down the hardware and software costs.</p>
          <p>The next step is to visit outlying franchise groups already in our pipeline. There are 2 franchises of
            particular interest, who happen to have a significant footprint in the local space...</p>

          <div class="grid">
            <div class="column">
              <h3>Doppio Zero</h3>
              <p>Having touched base with co-founder Paul Christie a year ago, he put us in contact with the operations
                manager of the group, Jason Carrozzo, to evaluate Smooth’s compatibility with the restaurant chain’s
                operations.<br /><br />Smooth ticked all the boxes, and he committed to a roll-out in the new store they
                were opening in Kyalami, and a phased approach to the other stores in the group once the team finds its
                feet in the transition. We were still in the process of building Smooth’s inventory feature at the time,
                but he committed to on-boarding as soon as that was complete. Needless to say, we’re a lot further down
                the road now.<br /><br />There are 18 Doppio Zero stores across the country, and 2 more in Egypt. A
                local franchise with cross-border roots allows us to establish a presence on the international scene,
                within a controlled environment.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="column">
              <h3>Piza e Vino</h3>
              <p>Piza e Vino is a part of the Doppio Zero group. Our conversation with Mr Carrozzo involved a roll-out
                to all stores under the umbrella after up-take at the Kyalami branch.</p>
              <p>This includes 13 Piza e Vino locations nation-wide.</p>
              <p>Establishing a presence within these stores is likely to generate substantial market-buzz.</p>

              <h2>Address Transparency</h2>
              <p>We’ve baked certain features into Smooth that make it incomparable to other solutions from the
                perspective of the franchisor. Traditional points of sale offer zero transparency and control to the
                franchisor.</p>

              <div class="process step-2"></div>
              <h2>Address Topology</h2>
              <p>Solutions are disconnected to such an extent, that the franchisor has to rely on franchisees for
                submission of turnover reports or other data and statistics which can offer significant value in
                plotting marketing and operational initiatives.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <div class="process step-3"></div>
              <h2>Consolidated View</h2>
              <p>One of the ways in which Smooth addresses this is through a feature called “Dashboard”. A franchisor
                now has the ability to get real-time data on any store in the group. Live updates to menus, food cost,
                turnover, purchases - it’s now in plain sight of the franchisor, and under his complete control. As it
                should be.</p>

            <li>
              <div class="process step-4"></div>
              <h2>Rollout</h2>
              <p>After establishing industry credibility through installation in franchises such as Cappuccinos, Doppio
                Zero and Piza e Vino, our acquisition strategy in phase 2 focuses on a much wider franchise roll-out.

          <p>Initial penetration within the app stores will be based on targeted marketing, aiming for smaller groups in

            <p>Our focus shifts from early adopters online, to scale customers. Support systems and infrastructure are
